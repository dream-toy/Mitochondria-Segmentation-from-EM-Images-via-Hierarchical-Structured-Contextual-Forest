 Mitochondria Segmentation from EM Images via Hierarchical Structured Contextual Forest

This project contains the code used for the experiments in the paper:
"Mitochondria segmentation from EM images via hierarchical structured contextual forest." in JBHI, by Jialin Peng and Zhimin Yuan.

You can run this code on Linux or Windows.

Segmentation Result
-----
The final segmentation result of our 3D segmentation framework is also contained. Please open the 'pro.mat' in Matlab.

The other code and segmentation result(Hierarchical multi-view fusion: a pseudo 3D variant) will be release soon.
